# ATM-System-using-verilog
The objective of this project is to carry out ASIC design and verification for an ATM-based banking system. The project assumes that auxiliary devices, such as card handling, money counting, and timers, are already available. Moreover, it is assumed that account information, such as passwords, account numbers, and balances, is stored locally and does not require a database connection.
